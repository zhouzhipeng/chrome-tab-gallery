Detailed description:
Tab Gallery is a visual tab manager that opens in a compact Chrome popup (like Google Translate).
See all open tabs as crisp previews, jump to any tab instantly, and close tabs in one click.
Filter your tabs and batch move or close the results in one step.

Default shortcut :
Ctrl+B or Cmd+B

Highlights:
- Popup UI: open from the toolbar icon, no extra windows or tabs.
- High-resolution previews: 2560x1440 thumbnails cached per tab.
- Smart order: most recently active tabs appear first.
- Fast search: URL > title > page body text. Also support boolean query using 'and' / 'or' keyword.
- Full URL display: decoded URLs with highlighted query values.
- Quick actions: click a card to switch, use the x button to close.
- Operations bar: when a search filters tabs, move or close the matched set.

How it works:
- Captures the visible tab when needed and stores previews locally.
- Reads plain text from the page body (no HTML tags) for search.
- Updates the grid live as you browse.

Notes:
- Some internal pages (chrome://, extension pages) cannot be read or captured.
- Body text is cached after a tab is seen; inactive/discarded tabs may need activation once.
