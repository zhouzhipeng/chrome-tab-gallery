Last updated: 2025-01-01

## Summary
Tab Gallery is a local-only tab manager. All data stays on your device and is never sent to any server.

## Data We Process
Tab Gallery accesses the following data to provide its core functionality:
- Tab metadata (URL, title, status) via the `tabs` permission.
- Optional page body text (plain text only, no HTML) for search.
- Tab previews (screenshots) to display visual thumbnails.

## How We Use the Data
All data is used only to render the popup UI:
- Show tab previews and metadata.
- Enable search across URL, title, and body text.
- Sort tabs by recent activity.

## Storage
Data is stored locally using `chrome.storage.local`:
- Previews (images) for recent tabs.
- Cached body text for search.
- Last active timestamps.

## Data Sharing
Tab Gallery does not transmit, sell, or share any data with third parties.

## User Control
You can clear all stored data by:
